          Lunar New Year Festival (LNYF) is an annual student-run production staged in commemoration and celebration of the Lunar New Year.
          LNYF seeks to leave a prolonged impact both on and off the stage. Dynamic performances ranging from acting to dancing to martial arts explore Asian heritage from both traditional and modern perspectives, and acknowledge social issues prevalent in Asian communities. LNYF partners with local non-profit organizations to offer sustainable support to the greater St Louis community.

          LNYF is proud to partner with St. Louis Queer Support & Healing (SQSH) as its philanthropy for the Year of the Snake.

        <Typography style={{ "font-weight": "bold" }}> About the Philanthropy: </Typography>

        <Typography>
          A group of dedicated queer St. Louisans founded SQSH on June 1, 2019, after a community needs assessment demonstrated that the St. Louis LGBTQIA+ community faces increased rates of violence, discrimination, substance use, and insecurity in employment and housing; disparities in medical, mental, and sexual health; and barriers to accessing the identity-affirming resources needed to meet those needs.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          SQSH’s mission is to strengthen the St. Louis queer community by building collective skills for peer support, active listening, and navigating conflict. It operates a telephone support line five days a week, builds deep connections within the local community, and partners with civil rights organizations to advocate for LGBTQIA+ needs. SQSH aims to create alternative models, strategies, and practices that moves the LGBTQIA+ community closer to collective liberation.
